This is the code of the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, which is based on FanZhang's framework. 

In this tic-tac-toe game, human player has options to choose the first player and whether to implement alpha-beta pruning. If the computer player goes first, it will select its first movement randomly. Regardless the initial setting at the beginning of this game, the algorithm will find the most optimal solutions and the results show that human can hardly beat the AI in this game.
